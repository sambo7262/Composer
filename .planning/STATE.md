## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Fully self-hosted v1 -- Essentia for audio features, Ollama for LLM, no external APIs
- [Roadmap]: Stack: Python 3.12 + FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite + Jinja2/HTMX/Alpine.js/Tailwind CSS
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5 and 6 can run in parallel (both depend on Phase 4, not each other)
- [Revision]: Moved DEPL-01/DEPL-02 into Phase 1 so Docker Hub deployment is available from the start -- user iterates by pulling and rebuilding on NAS
- [Phase 01]: Lazy engine singleton pattern for database -- allows test isolation by resetting engine between tests
- [Phase 01]: TemplateResponse uses new request-first parameter order (Starlette deprecation fix)
- [Phase 01]: Local dev uses Python 3.9 with future annotations; Docker targets Python 3.12
- [Phase 01]: HTMX test-and-configure pattern: form hx-post to test endpoint, connection_status partial swapped in, save replaces entire service card
- [Phase 01]: Service card id={service}-card pattern enables HTMX swap targeting across test/save/reconfigure flows

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research flag]: Essentia Python bindings in python:3.12-slim Docker image -- C++ build complexity, image size, multi-stage build patterns (affects Phase 3)
